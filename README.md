## Installation

To install xjectro-express, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install xjectro-express
```

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

After installation, you can set up a basic Express server with just a few lines of code. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { createServer } from 'xjectro-express';

const app = createServer();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

This code snippet creates a basic Express server that responds with "Hello, World!" when you access the root URL.

## Usage

### Middleware

You can easily add middleware to your xjectro-express server. For example, to use a logging middleware:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { createServer } from 'xjectro-express';
import morgan from 'morgan';

const app = createServer();

app.use(morgan('dev'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### ID Generator

To generate unique IDs, you can use the built-in ID generator. Here's how:

```javascript
import { generateId } from 'xjectro-express';

const uniqueId = generateId();
console.log(uniqueId); // Outputs a unique identifier
```

### JWT Authentication

Implementing JWT authentication is straightforward. You can use the provided methods to sign and verify tokens:

```javascript
import { signToken, verifyToken } from 'xjectro-express';

const token = signToken({ userId: 123 });
console.log(token); // Outputs a signed JWT

const decoded = verifyToken(token);
console.log(decoded); // Outputs the decoded payload
```

### Validation

The package also includes validation tools to help you ensure that your data meets certain criteria:

```javascript
import { validate } from 'xjectro-express';

const data = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const rules = { name: 'string', age: 'number' };

const isValid = validate(data, rules);
console.log(isValid); // Outputs true or false based on validation
```
